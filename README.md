## Project Scope (Brief)
A 2D Side scroller sci-fi themed pixel-art style mobile game where the player controls a knight that travels to many different castles across the galaxy to save his princess

## Project Scope (Detailed)
The mobile game consists of 2 gamemodes: Adventure and Arcade 

### Adventure mode 
This mode will also serve as an introduction to the game's controls and the user in a story-based setting that slowly introduces the user to the various mechanics of the game as they play.

### Arcade mode 
This mode will provide an environment where players can play the fllowing submodes:
  - Endless Run: Players will play an infinite duration run of their choice of level with increasingly difficult challenges as time goes on
  - Timed Trial: Setting a high score within a set time limit
  - Sandbox Exploration: Allows for exploration of the game levels without restrictions

### Achievements:
Players will be able to get achievements in both the adventure and arcade modes where they have to meet certain conditions to be able to get it. Friends of the user can also see what medals the user has gotten in their settings.

## Motivation
University life can at times feel stressful and students often can't find the time to destress, especially during busy time periods. As such, we want to create a 2D side scroller mobile game app as a way for students to destress during these tough periods.

Mobile games are an easy and convenient way to destress compared to console or computer games, and can be played on the go, such as during commute on the train/bus. 2D Side scroller games are also not as demanding in terms of attention from the user as compared to other genres like first-person shooter games. This makes it an ideal game to play to destress when needed and great for people to play during commute where they still have to pay attention to their surroundings.

The higher capabilities of smartphones today allow more things to be done on one device, and are also an integral part of daily life for most people. Having the game in the form of a mobile app makes it more convenient for the user to access the game wherever they go.
